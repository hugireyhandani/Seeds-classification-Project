# Seeds Classification Project

## Overview
This project, part of the MET CS 677 Data Science with Python course, is by Hugi Reyhandani Munggaran. It focuses on classifying seeds using various machine learning models.

## Key Objectives
- Develop models to classify seeds.
- Evaluate the performance of different classifiers.

## Models Used
- SVM with Linear, Gaussian, and Polynomial Kernels.
- kNN Classifier.

## Results and Analysis
- Performance metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices were used for evaluation.
- SVM with Gaussian and Polynomial Kernels showed high accuracy.
- Optimal k value for kNN was determined using the Elbow Method.

## Conclusions
- Different models have varying levels of effectiveness in seed classification.
- The Gaussian and Polynomial SVMs had similar high accuracies.
- kNN also performed well with the right choice of k.
